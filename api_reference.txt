API for protocol 1200

SERVER STATES:
    1 - Join to chat
    2 - Send message
    3 - Send file to user
    4 - Server protocol
    5 - Error occured on server side:
        Reason 0 - Already connected to server

1. Connect to WebSocket and send this message:
    {
        "state": 1,
        "user": "your username"
    }
2. Wait for this response:
    {
        "state": 1
    }
   If you got this message:
    {
        "state": 5,
        "reason": (number)
    }
   It means that server got error on joining process. Parse "reason" to get information.
3. Server also will send his protocol version:
    {
        "state": 4,
        "protocol": 1100
    }
   You should to check client protocol number or you may get into some troubles

Sending messages:
    This is very easy. Just send this message to server:
        {
            "state": 2,
            "message": "your message here"
        }
    Then server will send your message to all users connected to it with this response:
        {
            "state": 2,
            "message": "server message"
        }
    Just print "message" cuz it already formatted on server side
Sending files:
    This is a bit difficult. First read file contents, get username to send file and filename:
        {
            "state": 3,
            "data": "File contents in hex",
            "user": "username or" null "if you want send file everyone",
            "filename": "filename"
        }
    Others will get this server message:
        {
			state: 3,
			data: "file contents in hex",
			filename: "filename to save",
			message: "message"
        }
Help command /api:
    This is a secret command that can help you in bot developing.
